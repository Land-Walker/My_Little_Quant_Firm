# TODO list

## Data Processing
- check if different data processing method would result varying performance of the model (student-t, wavelet transform, etc.)

## Architecture
- access scenario generation function in run.py
- improve config.py so that all hyperparameters/parameters can be controlled solely in config.py

## Evaluation
- set narrower setting for the original VS my model comparison (e.g. hyperparameter, learning rate, etc)
